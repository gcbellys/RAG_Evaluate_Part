management. mr. was worked-up in the usual preoperative manner. on , mr. was taken to the operating room where he underwent coronary artery bypass grafting to three vessels. postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit for monitoring. on postoperative day one, mr. e neurologically intact and was extubated. he was slowly weaned from pressor support over the next three days. the physical therapy service was consulted for assistance with his postoperative strength and mobility. he was gently diuresed towards his preoperative weight. on postoperative day four, mr. was transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for further recovery. his drains and epicardial pacing wires were removed per protocol. toradol was used for treatment of his sternal pain with good effect. the diabetes service was consulted for assistance with his diabetes medications as his blood sugars remained high on his preoperative regimen. mr. continued to make steady progress and was

hospitalization which was a two week course. the patient responded well clinically with significant improvement in edema, swelling, erythema and pain in the right lower extremity. the patient did have persistent right greater than left lower extremity edema that was thought to be a result of the known lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. the patient had one blood culture out of four bottles

control for this patient. the patient had no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis during his hospitalization. 4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - the patient has a known large oxygen requirement of over five liters per minute. this is probably the result of his long smoking history. the patient intermittently required more than five liters of oxygen at various times and this was thought to be related to his recent history of pulmonary embolus, however, the patient was essentially stable through the latter part of his hospitalization on five liters of oxygen. he did desaturate to the 70s

appropriately low heart rate of 50 to 60. the patient was closely monitored, given aggressive fluid resuscitation and nevertheless suffered oliguric acute renal failure. the patient's creatinine

clearance and decrease in his creatinine to 1.2 which was actually better than reported baseline of 1.3 to 1.4. the patient had good urine output and was tolerating his lasix regimen at the time of discharge. the patient was diuresed aggressively after his renal failure improved due to the fluid overload state that occurred while he was oliguric. the patient did suffer from some degree of renal encephalopathy when his blood urea nitrogen approached 100, however, the mental status improved with improvement of his renal function. the patient was not discharged on a beta blocker due to this history of bradycardia. he was sinus bradycardic throughout the episode of bradycardia. no evidence of conduction disease. 6. congestive heart failure - the patient was discharged on his doses of lasix 40 mg once daily rather than the larger dose due to his recent renal failure and his stable status on 40 mg a day. it would be recommended that the patient be transitioned back onto his ace

resistant staphylococcus aureus bacteremia that was thought to be related to his diabetic foot. it is also possible that this positive blood culture was a contaminant, however, he was treated with a two week course for bacteremia nevertheless. the patient was afebrile with a significant improvement in his white blood cell count and left shift at the time of discharge. the patient had no signs of active infection throughout his admission and had a normal sedimentation rate at the time of discharge. 3. diabetes mellitus - the patient was treated with large doses of nph and regular insulin throughout his admission. the patient and his wife continuously expressed concern that the patient was receiving too much insulin despite reassurance and despite fingerstick ranging from 90 to 150 throughout his hospitalization. the patient had good glycemic control on the insulin regimen of nph 30 units q.a.m. and 20 units q.p.m. and regular insulin 15 units q.breakfast and 10 units with dinner every day achieved good glycemic control for this patient. the patient had no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis during his hospitalization. 4. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease - the patient has a known large oxygen requirement of over five liters per minute. this is probably the result of his long smoking history. the patient intermittently required more than five liters of oxygen at various times and this was thought to be related to his recent history of pulmonary embolus, however, the patient was essentially stable through the latter part of his hospitalization on five liters of oxygen. he did desaturate to the 70s when his oxygen fell off his face or was removed. therefore, the patient was discharged with his five liters of home oxygen which was the same regimen he was admitted with. there was some question of whether or not the patient had been getting proper oxygen therapy at home. the patient's refused vna services to insure that he was getting his oxygen, but was set up with home oxygen prior to discharge. the patient also was continued on combivent inhalers q6hours, salmeterol q12hours and p.r.n. albuterol. 5. acute renal failure - the patient after being called out to the floor after a 24 hour intensive care unit stay was bradycardic as a result of his lopressor dosing which is unclear if he had actually been taking at home. the patient had pressure in the 80s to 90s and an appropriately low heart rate of 50 to 60. the patient was closely monitored, given aggressive fluid resuscitation and nevertheless suffered oliguric acute renal failure. the patient's creatinine peaked at 3.3, however, as the beta blocker wore off, the patient's heart rate improved, blood pressure improved, renal perfusion improved, and urine output improved with recovery of his creatinine clearance and decrease in his creatinine to 1.2 which was actually better than reported baseline of 1.3 to 1.4. the patient had good urine output and was tolerating his lasix regimen at the time of discharge. the patient was diuresed aggressively after his renal failure improved due to the fluid overload state that occurred while he was oliguric. the patient did suffer from some degree of renal encephalopathy when his blood urea nitrogen approached 100, however, the mental status improved with improvement of his renal function. the patient was not discharged on a beta blocker due to this history of bradycardia. he was sinus bradycardic throughout the episode of bradycardia. no evidence of conduction disease. 6. congestive heart failure - the patient was discharged on his doses of lasix 40 mg once daily rather than the larger dose due to his recent renal failure and his stable status on 40 mg a day. it would be recommended that the patient be transitioned back onto his ace inhibitor in the future, however, his pressure remained in the low 100s and we avoided sending him home on ace inhibitor due to his renal failure."}}}, {"u_id":
